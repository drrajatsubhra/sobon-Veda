[Download the PDF â€“ SOBON English Paper with Table](SOBON_English_Paper_with_Table.pdf)
Sobon is a Vedic technique described in the Yajurveda as an inner rhythmic *homa* for generating *Soma* (life force). 
This research is based on experiential practice by Dr. Rajatsubhra Mukhopadhyay (Sri Yoga Center, Kunarpur).

The process involves:
- Inner chanting (*japa*) as the fuel for the internal fire.
- Awakening of the life-force (*Soma*) within body and mind.
- Integration with universal peace and fraternity, as emphasized in Vedic texts.
