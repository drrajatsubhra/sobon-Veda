Sobon: A Vedic rhythmic inner Homa process for generating Soma. Based on Yajurveda and experiential research by Dr. Rajatsubhra Mukhopadhyay (Sri Yoga Center, Kunarpur
# The Sobon in the Veda

**“The Sobon in the Veda”** is a unique Vedic exploration into *Sobon* — the inner rhythmic process that generates *Soma* (life-force) in the human body through vibratory Homa as described in the Yajurveda (Page 634, *Bhutestaka*). 

In this book, **Dr. Rajatsubhra Mukhopadhyay** introduces Sobon as a physiological and spiritual method based on internal Havan (Yajna), where the chant-fueled fire transforms consciousness and helps realize the Supreme Soul (*Paramatma*).

Drawing upon ancient scripture and experiential research from **Sri Yoga Center, Kunarpur (West Bengal, India)**, the book presents how Sobon acts as an inner *Agni Kriya* — similar to clarified butter (*ghrita*) and wood (*samidha*) offered in external fire rituals — but taking place within the body as a self-driven purification process.

This work is a grassroots contribution to spiritual science, written and published from a rural research and wellness center, and emphasizes universal peace, discipline, and inner harmony through Vedic rhythm and chanting. The book also documents its connection with chronobiology, emotional regulation, and spiritual realization through daily practice.
