# Sobon-Veda: Inner Rhythmic Homa Process in the Vedas

This repository presents *Sobon* (সবন), a Vedic rhythmic inner Homa process that generates *Soma* (life-affirming energy) through structured chanting (*Japa*), metrical rhythm (*Chanda*), and time cycles (*Kala*).  

Sobon is an **inner Yajna**, where the mantra-fueled flame purifies the body-mind system and connects the practitioner with the Supreme Soul (*Paramatma*). Rooted in the *Rig, Yajur, Sama, and Atharva Vedas*, this practice has been documented through both scriptural study and experiential research.
**“The Sobon in the Veda”** is a unique Vedic exploration into *Sobon* — the inner rhythmic process that generates *Soma* (life-force) in the human body through vibratory Homa as described in the Yajurveda (Page 634, *Bhutestaka*). 

In this book, **Dr. Rajatsubhra Mukhopadhyay** introduces Sobon as a physiological and spiritual method based on internal Havan (Yajna), where the chant-fueled fire transforms consciousness and helps realize the Supreme Soul (*Paramatma*).

Drawing upon ancient scripture and experiential research from **Sri Yoga Center, Kunarpur (West Bengal, India)**, the book presents how Sobon acts as an inner *Agni Kriya* — similar to clarified butter (*ghrita*) and wood (*samidha*) offered in external fire rituals — but taking place within the body as a self-driven purification process.

This work is a grassroots contribution to spiritual science, written and published from a rural research and wellness center, and emphasizes universal peace, discipline, and inner harmony through Vedic rhythm and chanting. The book also documents its connection with chronobiology, emotional regulation, and spiritual realization through daily practice.
